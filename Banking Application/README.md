	register: jumps to Register frame where the user is prompted for a new customer account
	exit: This exits the program

	accept: this will create a customer and return a customer ID number assuming name and PIN are acceptable
	back: This just jumps to the LoginFrame (no action taken)

3.SelectionFrame: This is the main hub of the project. Here all choices are given to the user for account uses
	Open Account: This Choice will add an account object to an existing customer object and add it to a corresponding ArrayList

Admin has a pin requirement which is hard coded at "abcd" and will open a menu
